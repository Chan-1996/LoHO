deal but you know if you get somebody who likes to cook and someone who doesn't like to cook then the person who doesn't who doesn't like to cook probably likes to do something else you know so i think that people end up i think that that women are more diverse now than they ever were as far as what they have learned and what they're capable of and and uh what they're willing to do and so i feel like it you know that men have gotten to be that way too they've gotten a little bit more relaxed in their thinking about uh women and you know what they expect of them so i think that you know it's a slow evolution but i think it's it's it's a good process i think it's it's working you know there are still people who men who believe that women should be home you know all day	People tend to

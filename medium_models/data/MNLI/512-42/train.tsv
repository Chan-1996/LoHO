The Jenkins Committee (named after the chairman), a group formed by the AICPA in 1991 to address concerns over the relevance and usefulness of financial reporting, recommended in its 1994 report that standard setters develop a comprehensive reporting model that includes both financial information (financial statements and related disclosures) and nonfinancial information (such as high-level operating data and performance measures used by management, management's analysis of changes in financial and nonfinancial data, and forward-looking information about opportunities, risks, and management's plans).	The Jenkins Committee was formed in 1981.	contradiction	contradiction

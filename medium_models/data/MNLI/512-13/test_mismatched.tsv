This edition when published was said to give more word definitions than any other British desk dictionary; including its main competitor, The Concise Oxford . But in 1986 it was moved into second place by the second edition of Collins Dictionary of the English Language .  ( Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language seems about the same size as the Oxford ; the Gage Canadian Dictionary is slightly smaller.)	This dictionary did not have nearly as many words as any of the others of that time period. 	contradiction	entailment	contradiction	contradiction	contradiction	contradiction
